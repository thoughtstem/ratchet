Use pasteboard% for legend, not canvases
  Make it hideable.  Hidden by default.

Be able to control how the code evals (e.g. to
  wrap in a top-level function/macro)

Be able to embed source code for visual langs
  in scribble
  Can we define a syntax with those embedded icons?  
    Need Cut-and-paste from visual editor to test

Be able to easily print tangible interface 
  components (keyboard overlay, cards/tiles)

Memorizing a gigantic volume of grandmaster chess games...
  Would that make someone a grandmaster?
  How long does it take to memorize a game?

Racket interface to a chess engine
  Configure its various parameters,
  construct a high level algorithm
  Pit algorithms against each other...
  Construct training programs for yourself

Racket flashcards...
  Can code your own education...
  Test out different learning algorithms...
  Leverage SRS system as a tool... not as the overarching algorithm...

End User Programming requires coding eduction.
  You can't have one without the other.  Skip a lanuage / Teach a language.

Why not use an actual #lang ___ ?
  Want keyboard shortcuts though.
  Still maybe it's worth considering having Racket be able to run 
     cut-and-pasted programs natively in the usual editor.
  Seems like the #lang reader could easily strip out the bitmaps and replace with letters before running it.  Could easily prototype a #lang that does this.
